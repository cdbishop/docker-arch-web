This container derives from
[vcatechnology/arch](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/arch) so that the
image has the latest [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) packages. It then
installs the various browsers and packages needed to perform unit tests on the broswers.

Available on Docker Hub as [vcatechnology/arch-web](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/arch-web/)
